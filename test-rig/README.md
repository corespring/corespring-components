# Test Rig

This rig runs the component tests

## Usage

    grunt testclient:corespring:multiple-choice:render --componentPath=../components

    # Note : filtering isn't fully working yet
    # You have to specify componentPath

## Server side

Todo..

## Client side

Due to how components are defined, we need to wrap the definitions and then run those generated files in the tests. look for *-wrapped.js files.
